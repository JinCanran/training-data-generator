These libraries are mandatory to run the generator script:

pyqrcode
cv2
numpy

To run the generator script, place it in the same directory (or within a subdirectory of the script directory) 
as a number of images that will serve as the background images. These images are preferably photos of realistic 
and/or common environments.

Then, simply run the generator script to add randomized QR codes to each image, this composite image is saved 
seperately as original_image_name.png. The region of the QR code in the new image is saved as either a CSV or
json file.
